After a thorough research, I have prepared a list of conferences that members of the Debian Community attend (refer List 1 given below). There are certain other conference venues that I think will be good for the community members to attend to spread the word about the Debian ecosystem (Refer list 2 given below). 
List 1:
        DebConf: The Debian Developer Conference (DebConf) is a yearly conference which attracts speakers from around the world. It gives              an oportunity to the interested people (developers, contributors, users) to. For more details, look here https://debconf.org/.
