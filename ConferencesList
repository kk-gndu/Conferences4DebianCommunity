After a thorough research, I have prepared a list of conferences that members of the Debian Community attend (refer List 1 given below). There are certain other conference venues that I think will be good for the community members to attend to spread the word about the Debian ecosystem (Refer list 2 given below). 
List 1:
	DebConf: The Debian Developer Conference (DebConf) is a yearly conference (since 2000) which attracts speakers from around the world. It gives an oportunity to the interested people (developers, contributors, users) to. For more details, go to https://debconf.org/.
	MiniDebConfs are local meetings organized by members of the Debian Project and local Free and Open Source project related communities to achieve objectives similar to those of DebConf, but in a smaller scale and regional context. For more details, go to https://wiki.debian.org/MiniDebConf
	FOSDEM is a free event (sponsors inclue Google and redhat) for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. The event is organized every year at Brussels. For more details, go to https://fosdem.org/2018/.
