While I was looking for conferences that members of the Debian Community attend, I got two prominent events exclusively for the community. these events are as follows:
	DebConf: The Debian Developer Conference (DebConf) is a yearly conference (since 2000) which attracts speakers from around the world. It gives an oportunity to the interested people (developers, contributors, users) to. For more details, go to https://debconf.org/.
	MiniDebConfs are local meetings organized by members of the Debian Project and local Free and Open Source project related communities to achieve objectives similar to those of DebConf, but in a smaller scale and regional context. For more details, go to https://wiki.debian.org/MiniDebConffollowing is a list of . 
There are certain other conference venues that I think will be good for the community members to attend to spread the word about the Debian ecosystem. These are regular events held annually. See the following for details regarding name, focus, and hosting websites.
	FOSDEM is a free event (sponsors inclue Google and redhat) for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. The event is organized every year at Brussels. For more details, go to https://fosdem.org/2018/.  
	Free Software and Open Source Symposium (FSOSS) is a yearly event at the Seneca@York campus, Toronto on a wide range of open source topics, issues, the development of open source technologies, and ideas ranging from business to technical to community management.

	Free and Open Source Software Conference (FrosCon) is held every year in August by the computer science department of the University of Applied Sciences, Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in Sankt Augustin with focus on current trends and developments in all areas of Free and Open Source Software, e.g.:     Operating systems, Software development, Legal aspects, IT Security etc. For more details, go to https://www.froscon.de/en/
	OW2Con is an annual conference event (since 2012) organized by the OW2 community. Every year the focus is on some aspect of the Open Source Software.

I will keep on exploring to extend this list further. Thanks
